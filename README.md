# Ferris-wheel

The Ferris Wheel project involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive simulation of a ferris wheel. HTML structured the elements of the ferris wheel, CSS was applied to style its appearance, and JavaScript powered the animation and user interaction. The ferris wheel spins and responds to user clicks, illustrating my ability to combine all three web technologies to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.
